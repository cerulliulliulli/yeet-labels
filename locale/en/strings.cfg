title_delivery_cannons=YEET MACHINE
page_delivery_cannons_text_1=YEET MACHINE are explosion-assisted railguns with interplanetary range. They are designed to fire sturdy homogeneous resources that can survive the sudden acceleration. They cannot fire more complicated manufactured intermediates or structures.\n\nA delivery cannon only has a target point, it does not have any understanding of what is at that point and will fire the payload as long as it has power and a filled delivery capsule. If you want to add conditions to the cannon’s ability to fire, you restrict the cannon’s ability to load resources or capsules.\n\nWhen a delivery capsule lands on the ground it damages the area and most of the resources are destroyed. A delivery cannon chest can safely catch the capsule as long as the chest is not full. You can have multiple cannons firing at the same chest with different resources.\n\nIt is advisable to either keep targeted chests empty, or restrict cannon inputs using signal transmission.\n\nDelivery cannons have a 1GJ capacity and draw 50MW when charging. The range of the delivery cannon is constrained by the amount of energy it can store. Firing at more distant locations takes more energy. Some destinations may require more energy than the delivery cannon can hold so it will never fire. You can set up a delivery cannon relay station in a location half way there to send the cargo in 2 stages.

se-delivery-cannon=A railgun capable of shooting resources into orbit and beyond, and an armoured chest to catch them.
se-delivery-cannon-capsule-iridium=Although iridium is a heavy metal, the increased durability means less material can be used compared to a standard delivery capsule. The overall weight is the same but it is simpler to manufacture.
se-delivery-cannon-weapon=A large railgun capable of shooting special ammunitions offensively, such as an atomic bomb, to attack other surfaces. The only thing catching these are BITER FACES.
